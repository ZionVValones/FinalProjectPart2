<p>The temperature of our world is increasing, sea levels are rising and glaciers are melting. This is the evidence 
of climate change we are now experiencing. Everyone must take part in climate action because this will affect the future's 
situation. This website is based on SDG 13 and shows actions that today's generation are encouraged to do on the specific 
measures that an adult, student, and child can do for a sustainable environment and climate.</p>

<p>Everyone has the opportunity to participate in climate action, regardless of age or background. A major change can be achieved 
by reducing garbage, water consumption, energy use, and by using sustainable transportation. Furthermore, one of the most important 
ways to address the current global problem is to support policies that have an impact on climate change. Together, the people of the 
world may fight climate change and save the environment.
